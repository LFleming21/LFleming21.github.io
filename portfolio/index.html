      <h2>Master of Science in Applied Data Science Portfolio Syracuse University School of Information Studies</h2>
      <p>Lessa Fleming<br>Lgersten@syr.edu</p>
      <p>
        As a Master’s degree student of Data Science at Syracuse University, my education included an in-depth education of a wide range of topics. These included statistics, machine learning, visualization, and big data with data management. Amazon web services define Data science as “Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data” (AWS, 2024). To prepare for a degree in Data Science 12 courses were completed for a total of 34 credits. These were done between two schools at Syracuse University. The School of Information Studies and the Whitman School of Management.
      </p>
      <p>To complete this there are primary core courses that total 18 credits, secondary courses that total 6 credits, electives that total 9 credits, and a Data Science portfolio. A track is chosen that allows a student to focus on specific areas of study. I followed big data and scripting as my specialties.
      </p>
      <p>Syracuse University’s Applied Data Science program is a program that works with two schools of study to prepare a student upon graduation to gain insights from data, and provide actionable feedback on those insights. The program allows for four tracks to allow the student to specialize:
      </p>
      <div class="bullet-points">
        <p>• Data and Business Analytics – delve deeper into the business applications of data science.</p>
        <p>• Language Analytics – focus on unstructured language data.</p>
        <p>• Data Pipelines and Platforms – explore data collection and data engineering.</p>
        <p>• Artificial Intelligence – learn how to use advanced deep learning predictive models in an ethical way.</p>
      </div>
      <p>After choosing a track and completing all the required courses upon graduation a student should be able to demonstrate a range of skills including:
      </p>
      <div class="bullet-points">
        <p>• Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies.</p>
        <p>• Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle.</p>
        <p>• Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight.</p>
        <p>• Use programming languages such as R and Python to support the generation of actionable insight.</p>
        <p>• Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences (including project sponsors and technical team leads.</p>
        <p>• Apply ethics in the development, use, and evaluation of data and predictive models (e.g., fairness, bias, transparency, privacy).</p>
      </div>
<p>To start the journey into Data Science the first class is important, this gives you your first step into this world and introduces you to the first language application, R Studio. IST 687 Introduction to Data Science starts a student off learning R studio and how to do basic functions. This includes pulling data, creating tables, and doing basic mining and visualizations. In any career, specifically the career path I am to follow moving into a lead Data Scientist role, this is the foundation to move further in any class or career. The project for this class was to obtain a data source that was large enough to provide actionable feedback. Smaller datasets, while having important data, can limit the feedback and be swayed more by outliers in the data. Large sets of data allow for a more accurate average and distribution of the data that can help minimize the effects of outliers.

      <div class="bullet-points">
        <p>• Identify a problem and the data needed for addressing the problem.</p>
        <p>• Perform basic computational scripting using R and other optional tools. </p>
        <p>• Transform data through processing, linking, aggregation, summarization, and searching.</p>
        <p>• Organize and manage data at various stages of a project life cycle.</p>
        <p>• Determine appropriate techniques for analyzing data.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The goal of this project is to learn the correct ways to locate data that had the right amount of data points from which to gain insight. In real life choosing your data set may not be an option and you will most likely be using the data provided, but knowing what to look for in a dataset is important so that if one is provided you can provide feedback if the data source is not appropriate for the business questions being asked. </p>

<p>Once the data set was obtained, it was then cleaned, and basic statistical analysis was performed to help learn the data set. Without knowing what is in your data set, going further on analysis will be difficult and not provide actional insights. The last step on this project was to perform a prediction analysis, while this dataset was not extremely large, it was successful in providing a prediction analysis. With this information, a tool was created to allow the client of the project to predict estimated costs for the insured patient based on identifying factors. </p>

<p>This project highlighted my ability to identify the business questions that needed to be answered with the data, choose the correct methodology for extracting those answers, and showcase the results in a manner that is understandable and actionable on the part of the business. This also allowed me to create tools to help with future predictions that can be adjusted and refined as the data set or data pool changes, allowing for additional points to be added to the prediction. </p>
