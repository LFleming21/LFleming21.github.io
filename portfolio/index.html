      <h2>Master of Science in Applied Data Science Portfolio Syracuse University School of Information Studies</h2>
      <p>Lessa Fleming<br>Lgersten@syr.edu</p>
      <p>
        As a Master’s degree student of Data Science at Syracuse University, my education included an in-depth education of a wide range of topics. These included statistics, machine learning, visualization, and big data with data management. Amazon web services define Data science as “Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data” (AWS, 2024). To prepare for a degree in Data Science 12 courses were completed for a total of 34 credits. These were done between two schools at Syracuse University. The School of Information Studies and the Whitman School of Management.
      </p>
      <p>To complete this there are primary core courses that total 18 credits, secondary courses that total 6 credits, electives that total 9 credits, and a Data Science portfolio. A track is chosen that allows a student to focus on specific areas of study. I followed big data and scripting as my specialties.
      </p>
      <p>Syracuse University’s Applied Data Science program is a program that works with two schools of study to prepare a student upon graduation to gain insights from data, and provide actionable feedback on those insights. The program allows for four tracks to allow the student to specialize:
      </p>
      <div class="bullet-points">
        <p>• Data and Business Analytics – delve deeper into the business applications of data science.</p>
        <p>• Language Analytics – focus on unstructured language data.</p>
        <p>• Data Pipelines and Platforms – explore data collection and data engineering.</p>
        <p>• Artificial Intelligence – learn how to use advanced deep learning predictive models in an ethical way.</p>
      </div>
      <p>After choosing a track and completing all the required courses upon graduation a student should be able to demonstrate a range of skills including:
      </p>
      <div class="bullet-points">
        <p>• Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies.</p>
        <p>• Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle.</p>
        <p>• Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight.</p>
        <p>• Use programming languages such as R and Python to support the generation of actionable insight.</p>
        <p>• Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences (including project sponsors and technical team leads.</p>
        <p>• Apply ethics in the development, use, and evaluation of data and predictive models (e.g., fairness, bias, transparency, privacy).</p>
