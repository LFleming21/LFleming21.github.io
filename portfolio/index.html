      <h2>Master of Science in Applied Data Science Portfolio Syracuse University School of Information Studies</h2>
      <p>Lessa Fleming<br>Lgersten@syr.edu</p>
      <p>
        As a Master’s degree student of Data Science at Syracuse University, my education included an in-depth education of a wide range of topics. These included statistics, machine learning, visualization, and big data with data management. Amazon web services define Data science as “Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data” (AWS, 2024). To prepare for a degree in Data Science 12 courses were completed for a total of 34 credits. These were done between two schools at Syracuse University. The School of Information Studies and the Whitman School of Management.
      </p>
      <p>To complete this there are primary core courses that total 18 credits, secondary courses that total 6 credits, electives that total 9 credits, and a Data Science portfolio. A track is chosen that allows a student to focus on specific areas of study. I followed big data and scripting as my specialties.
      </p>
      <p>Syracuse University’s Applied Data Science program is a program that works with two schools of study to prepare a student upon graduation to gain insights from data, and provide actionable feedback on those insights. The program allows for four tracks to allow the student to specialize:
      </p>
      <div class="bullet-points">
        <p>• Data and Business Analytics – delve deeper into the business applications of data science.</p>
        <p>• Language Analytics – focus on unstructured language data.</p>
        <p>• Data Pipelines and Platforms – explore data collection and data engineering.</p>
        <p>• Artificial Intelligence – learn how to use advanced deep learning predictive models in an ethical way.</p>
      </div>
      <p>After choosing a track and completing all the required courses upon graduation a student should be able to demonstrate a range of skills including:
      </p>
      <div class="bullet-points">
        <p>• Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies.</p>
        <p>• Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle.</p>
        <p>• Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight.</p>
        <p>• Use programming languages such as R and Python to support the generation of actionable insight.</p>
        <p>• Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences (including project sponsors and technical team leads.</p>
        <p>• Apply ethics in the development, use, and evaluation of data and predictive models (e.g., fairness, bias, transparency, privacy).</p>
      </div>
<p>To start the journey into Data Science the first class is important, this gives you your first step into this world and introduces you to the first language application, R Studio. IST 687 Introduction to Data Science starts a student off learning R studio and how to do basic functions. This includes pulling data, creating tables, and doing basic mining and visualizations. In any career, specifically the career path I am to follow moving into a lead Data Scientist role, this is the foundation to move further in any class or career. The project for this class was to obtain a data source that was large enough to provide actionable feedback. Smaller datasets, while having important data, can limit the feedback and be swayed more by outliers in the data. Large sets of data allow for a more accurate average and distribution of the data that can help minimize the effects of outliers.

        <p>• Determine appropriate techniques for analyzing data.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The goal of this project is to learn the correct ways to locate data that had the right amount of data points from which to gain insight. In real life choosing your data set may not be an option and you will most likely be using the data provided, but knowing what to look for in a dataset is important so that if one is provided you can provide feedback if the data source is not appropriate for the business questions being asked. </p>

<p>Once the data set was obtained, it was then cleaned, and basic statistical analysis was performed to help learn the data set. Without knowing what is in your data set, going further on analysis will be difficult and not provide actional insights. The last step on this project was to perform a prediction analysis, while this dataset was not extremely large, it was successful in providing a prediction analysis. With this information, a tool was created to allow the client of the project to predict estimated costs for the insured patient based on identifying factors. </p>

<p>This project highlighted my ability to identify the business questions that needed to be answered with the data, choose the correct methodology for extracting those answers, and showcase the results in a manner that is understandable and actionable on the part of the business. This also allowed me to create tools to help with future predictions that can be adjusted and refined as the data set or data pool changes, allowing for additional points to be added to the prediction. </p>

<p>One of the main analytical languages is Python. To be a good data scientist mastering this language is crucial. While I am no master at this yet, scripting for data analysis builds the foundation for Python and to succeed in further courses. To complete any work Anaconda was used to access Jupyter Notebook. This is just one method for accessing applications for Python.</p>

<p>As with all analytics this project started with a dataset. All data sets have errors and require cleaning before proper analytics can be performed. With this data set, I was able to create an in-depth analysis of the two data sets. This focused on the variables such as pricing, location, and customer satisfaction. Skills such as data munging, data visualizations, correlation analysis, and effectively communicating the results. This project helped me to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis techniques, data interpretation, and communication and build my skills as a data scientist.   </p>

<p>In the Applied Machine Learning project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of various machine learning algorithms and their practical applications. Using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas, I explored techniques including regression, classification, and clustering to analyze a diverse range of datasets. Machine learning is becoming used more and more in companies. These are things like chatbots and fraud protection. I gained valuable insights into the importance of hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation in improving models and generalization. Through this project, I enhanced my proficiency in data munging, model development, and result interpretation, strengthening my skill set in applied machine learning and data analysis. For this project, the analysis revealed a consistent year-over-year increase in mean salary offerings, with an average of $118,000.00 across all years, and the mean salary for 2022 was closely aligned with the overall average of the salaries.</P> 

<p>Visualizations such as histograms and density charts highlighted the distribution of salaries within the dataset, and the majority falling within the $100,000 to $200,000 range. When a word cloud analysis was completed of job descriptions it identified "Data Scientist," as the most used word providing insight into the skills and responsibilities associated with the role.</p>

<p>This project is important to me and all individuals who are looking to go into a data science career. Understanding the average salary and what the average increase is per year you can walk into an interview prepared to negotiate for your salary.</P>

<p>Through the analysis of two datasets on honeybee production and colony loss, several key findings emerged, indicating very concerning and scary trends in colony numbers, honey production, and beekeeper counts. Overall, there is a steady decline in these areas, with heavy and frightening implications for both the environment and the honey industry. Despite attempts to forecast future trends using ARIMA models, the results were inconclusive, suggesting that the current trend of colony loss is likely to persist, impacting honey production and costs.</p>

<p>Due to these findings, it is recommended to provide funding for initiatives aimed at incentivizing beekeeping and other bee-saving efforts. By improving the quantity and quality of beekeeping practices, it is hoped that the decline in colony number, honey production, and stabilization of sales could be mitigated. Once all of this is addressed, the hope is that the cost could also decrease for the price of honey. Overall, the analysis raises a concern about the urgent need to address the declining bee population and its implications for the environment and the honey industry. 
<p>While completing this project, a diverse set of skills were employed, ranging from data analysis and visualization to hypothesis testing and forecasting. The project involved the analysis of two datasets to identify trends and patterns in the data and data points analyzed. This skill is fundamental in various fields, on such field being data analytics which is directly related to my current career.</p> 

<p>Another skill employed was statistical analysis. Statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing and time-series analysis were employed to derive insights from the data. These techniques are widely applicable in multiple fields, most important for me is the healthcare field, and is used daily for making informed decisions based on data.</p>

<p>Visualizations such as histograms, density plots, and time-series plots were used to communicate findings effectively. This skill is valuable in roles that require presenting data-driven insights to stakeholders, such as data science, marketing, and consulting. Attempts were made to forecast future trends using ARIMA models. Forecasting skills are highly sought after in industries and demand planning to anticipate future outcomes and make strategic decisions in any career in data analytics or data science. Strong problem-solving skills are essential in virtually every profession, enabling individuals to tackle complex challenges and develop innovative solutions. This project demonstrated the ability to hypothesize and research and answer those questions. Additional skills utilized were communication and critical thinking. Knowing how to evaluate the data and draw meaningful conclusions and present them in a way others will understand and take action with them is imperative in any career or field. </p>

<p>By utilizing and enhancing these skills through project-based learning experiences like this one,  I was able to prepare myself for a wide range of career opportunities in fields such as data science, analytics, research, and consulting. These skills are highly transferable and applicable across diverse industries, making them valuable assets in today's data-driven world.</p>
