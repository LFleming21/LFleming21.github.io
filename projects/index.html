    <p>
    The team will have to pick a dataset to be analyzed. The dataset must have a minimum of 10,000 “values” (ex. a dataset with 10 attributes and 1,000 observations). The dataset does not have to be publicly available. For example, it could be a dataset from a student’s company (assuming confidential information is masked). </li>

    <p>This course will introduce popular data mining methods for extracting knowledge from data. The principles and theories of data mining methods will be discussed and will be related to the issues in applying data mining to problems. Students will also acquire
hands-on experience using state-of-the-art software to develop data mining solutions to
scientific and business problems. The focus of this course is in understanding of data
and how to formulate data mining tasks in order to solve problems using the data</p>

    <h2>Scripting for Data Analysis</h2>	
   <h3><a href="./scripting/Lessa_Fleming_Final_project_paper_061023.pdf">Scripting for Data Analysis Report</a></h3>
   <h3><a href="./scripting/Airbnb_Project.pdf">Scripting for Data Analysis Slides</a></h3>
    <p>The goal of this class is to teach students the tools and skills of scripting needed to solve problems of accessing and preparing data in a variety of formats and situations, sometimes known as data wrangling. The scripting will provide the skills needed to form data science pipelines, from acquiring and cleaning data to accessing data and transforming data for analysis or visualization.</p>

<p>The main content focus is on information access and processing tasks on the types of
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in current use in information applications. For these three types of data, the course includes the use of structured numeric and text data such as that from a spreadsheet or database, the use of data obtained through standard data exchange formats such as HTML or XML from web pages or JSON from web-based APIs, and the use of data obtained by pattern matching from text or log files. The scripting language Python was chosen because of its ease of use and available packages to work with data in many information applications. The skills learned in this class are intended to complement the analytical and visualization skills learned in other data science courses. The scripting language Python will be taught, but it will be assumed that students already have a programming background, through either coursework or online study.</p>

     <h2>Big Data Analytics</h2>
    <h3><a href="./big_data_analytics/Honeybee_Production_and_Colony_Loss_Report.pdf">Big Data Analytics Report</a></h3>
    <h3><a href="./big_data_analytics/Honey_Bee_Project.pdf">Big Data Analytics Slides</a></h3>
    <p>A broad introduction to analytical processing tools and techniques for information professionals. Students will develop a portfolio of resources, demonstrations, recipes, and examples of various analytical techniques. </p>
   
     <h2>Advanced Big Data Management</h2>
    <h3><a href="./big_data_management/Project_Lessa_Fleming_IST769.pdf">Advanced Big Data Management Report</a></h3>
    <h3><a href="./big_data_management/Project.pdf">Advanced Big Data Management Code</a></h3>
    <p>This course provides a tour of relational, document, key-value, columnar, search, graph, and streaming database systems through the lens of scalability. We will explore the strengths and weaknesses of several popular database systems in the relational, Hadoop, and NoSQL spaces. Where possible you will experience these systems firsthand to gain an understanding of how they can be used to address complex, big data challenges</p>
